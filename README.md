# Course Project Learnings and Achievements: Throughout this project, I have gained valuable experience in various aspects of data analysis using Python and its libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. Here are some key learnings and achievements: Data Loading and Understanding: Successfully loaded the dataset and performed initial checks to understand its structure, data types, and identify missing values. Univariate Analysis: Explored the distribution of individual variables using various plotting techniques (histograms, boxplots, countplots) and derived meaningful insights about customer behavior, restaurant popularity, and order characteristics. Multivariate Analysis: Investigated relationships between multiple variables using scatter plots, boxplots, and heatmaps to understand how factors like cuisine type, cost, preparation time, and delivery time influence customer ratings and overall order experience. Answering Business Questions: Applied data analysis techniques to answer specific business questions posed by the company, such as identifying top restaurants, popular cuisines, frequent customers, and analyzing order delivery times and revenue. Providing Recommendations: Based on the data analysis, formulated actionable recommendations to help FoodHub improve its business by focusing on popular cuisines, enhancing customer engagement, optimizing delivery times, and leveraging promotional offers. Using Python Libraries: Gained proficiency in using key Python libraries for data manipulation (pandas, numpy) and data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn). Data Storytelling: Presented the findings and recommendations in a clear and concise manner, supported by visualizations, to effectively communicate the insights to stakeholders. This project has provided a solid foundation in data analysis and the ability to translate data into actionable business strategies.
